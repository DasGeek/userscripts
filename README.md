# Browser userscripts
A collection of userscripts that might be useful occaisionally.

## To install:
You must have a browser extension that gives you the ability to run custom userscripts, like Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey. I've only tested these scripts on Tampermonkey. 

Just click on the script you want to install and choose to view the raw text contents. A prompt should appear asking you if you want to install the script.
