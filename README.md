# Browser userscripts
A collection of userscripts that might be useful occaisionally.

## To install:
You must have a browser extension that gives you the ability to run custom userscripts, like Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey. I've only tested these scripts on Tampermonkey.

Once you have that, simply click on any of the script files you're interested in and choose to view the raw data. That should bring up a prompt for you to install the script. Once that's done, enjoy!
